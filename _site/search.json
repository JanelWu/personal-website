    "text": "I am a senior at UCLA, double majoring in Mathematics/Economics and Statistics & Data Science with a specialization in computing. Through coursework in statistics, calculus, linear algebra, and programming, I have developed a strong foundation in mathematical modeling and computational methods.\nDuring the Summer of 2023, I interned at Deloitte China, contributing to a live financial due diligence project. I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, client interaction, and report preparation, leveraging Excel to organize and present key findings.\nI am proficient in programming languages such as R, C++, and Python, which I use to solve complex problems and analyze data. My goal is to build a career in the financial sector, applying my technical and analytical skills to drive impactful results.\nEmail: janelwu4@g.ucla.edu"
